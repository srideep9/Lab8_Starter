Explore: How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation and service workers are related because graceful degradation is the opposite of progressive enhancement, meaning that resilience, performance, and accesibility must be added over time. In this case, we created network requests first, and are adding service workers to improve resilience so that the application we create is not super dependent on the network which we cannot control. By implementing service workers to reduce dependency on the internet, we are partaking in graceful degradation when developing the website.
